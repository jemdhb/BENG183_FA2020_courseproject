# Algorithms behind Spliced Transcript Alignment to a Reference  

#### STAR (Spliced Transcript Alignment to a Reference) is a efficient read mapping algorithm that handles RNA-Seq libraries

With the rapid development of sequencing technology and the need for sequencing coverage, modern RNA-Seq experimental runs can easily generate libraries of size 30~200 million reads.

The sheer size of the read libraries and the non-continuous nature of RNA-Seq reads overwhelms traditional RNA-Seq aligners, which suffers from slow runtime and high alignment error rates. STAR overcomes all such challenges with the combination of seed and extend approach and fast string search algorithm.

### Why do we care about alignment speed and mapping error
Modern computers are fast, with billions of transistors switching on and off at a rate of several gigahertz. However, the computation power we have is easily dwarfed by the size of input we wish to analyze. Given the length of genomes, even algorithms running in polynomial runtime can take an impractical time to execute.   

#### How bad is the Naïve approach?
The naïve string search algorithm is simple. The query string is slide over the reference text and char-by-char comparisons are made after each slide. [^5]



This approach works quite well for inputs of small size, but careful inspection of it execution reveals lot of unnecessary work. For instance: Try aligning AAAB to reference AAAAAAAAAA

```
1-1	⌄			1-2  ⌄			1-3	  ⌄			1-4	   ⌄		
	AAAAAAAAAA		AAAAAAAAAA		AAAAAAAAAA		AAAAAAAAAA
	AAAB			AAAB			AAAB			AAAB
	⌃				 ⌃				  ⌃				   ⌃				  		

2-1	 ⌄			2-2   ⌄			2-3	   ⌄		2-4	    ⌄		
	AAAAAAAAAA		AAAAAAAAAA		AAAAAAAAAA		AAAAAAAAAA
	 AAAB			 AAAB			 AAAB			 AAAB
	 ⌃				  ⌃				   ⌃				⌃			

...

7-1	      ⌄		7-2        ⌄	7-3	        ⌄	7-4	         ⌄		
	AAAAAAAAAA		AAAAAAAAAA		AAAAAAAAAA		AAAAAAAAAA
	      AAAB		      AAAB			  AAAB			  AAAB
	      ⌃				   ⌃				⌃				 ⌃
```
Notice that the algorithm repeatedly compares the first 3 "A"s in the query to the reference, only to arrive at the last "B" and realize the alignment at the current position fails. Eventually, the program will terminate after 28 total single-char comparisons.

For a reference text is 10 chars long and the query 4 chars long, do we really need to do more than 10 comparisons to be able to confidently report alignment status?  

The answer is no. An slightly improved version of the naïve string search, KMP algorithm, saves the extra comparisons by "remembering" what is previously compared and achieves linear time in the worst case. That is, any character in the reference will not be compared with the query in more than one sliding position. ^[6]^


When the input is millions of short reads and whole genomes, however, linear time is still considered too slow.


#### Mapping error

**Mapping error** typically occur when a RNA-Seq read spans the alternatively spliced junctions and one segment of the read is ambiguously assigned to more than one exons. [^7] 

Some aligners before STAR use the **split-read** approach. The read sequences are first split into smaller fragments, either based on prior knowledge of the junction site or certain preliminary continuous alignment result, and then individually aligned. The **mapping error** issue can arise from either incomplete annotation of the target transcriptome, biasing the alignment towards the known exons over the unknown ones.

### STAR Strategy
The efficient mapping of STAR is achieved through a 2 step process:

#### 1. Seed Search

**Maximal Mappable Prefix** (**MMPs**), sometimes more simply referred to as **seeds**, are segments of the RNA-Seq reads that exactly matches to the reference genome. [^3] STAR begins from the first base of the read sequence and extracts the segment that continuously matches to the genome. When a junction is hit, the continuous mapping terminates and a discrete **seed** is thus produced. The seed finding process is continued on the remainder of the unmapped reads, until the read is depleted.  

The seed search component of STAR is implemented as uncompressed **Suffix Array** (SA), which takes logarithmic time with respect to the size of genome.   

#### 2. Clustering, Stitching and Scoring

The "seeds" generated by seed search must be clustered, and "stitched" across gaps in order to produce the final alignments. The output also needs to be scored

1. In **Clustering**, **Anchor alignments** are used to facilitate the combination of seeds in proximity. **Anchor alignments** are alignments that map to some small, user defined value (typically between 20 to 50).

   Seeds near these **anchors** are clustered together to yield the best *linear complete alignment*.

2. In **Stitching**, clusters across gaps (splice junctions) are matched together. A complicated scoring function is rolled over the genomic region between clusters to optimize for the start and end of splice junctions and is implemented through **dynamic programming** to yield linear runtime.

3. **Scoring** is based on mismatches, indels, gaps and other genomic features that indicate *distance*. The user is able to define the quantity of penalties for each of the features.

### Suffix Array (SA)
**Suffix Array** is a data structure that enables for fast string/pattern search. 

It is introduced by Manber and Myers as an space efficient alternative to the **suffix tree**.  

In STAR, the reference text (in context of RNA-Seq, the genome) is first converted to a suffix array and stored as a text file. 

Consider length 14 genome AGCTGCATTACCGT, we initialize an array of of the size of that genome, and fill in the array element as integers 1 thru 14. 

| 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6    | 7    | 8    | 9    | 10   | 11   | 12   | 13   | 14   |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6    | 7    | 8    | 9    | 10   | 11   | 12   | 13   | 14   |

The Array itself is rather uninteresting, but the below illustration should indicate the meaning behind each integer:

| Index | i-th position in original genome | Represented Substring (w/o strike-through) |
| ----- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 1     | **A**GCTGCATTACCGT               | AGCTGCATTACCGT                             |
| 2     | A**G**CTGCATTACCGT               | ~~A~~GCTGCATTACCGT                         |
| 3     | AG**C**TGCATTACCGT               | ~~AG~~CTGCATTACCGT                         |
| 4     | AGC**T**GCATTACCGT               | ~~AGC~~TGCATTACCGT                         |
| 5     | AGCT**G**CATTACCGT               | ~~AGCT~~GCATTACCGT                         |
| 6     | AGCTG**C**ATTACCGT               | ~~AGCTG~~CATTACCGT                         |
| 7     | AGCTGC**A**TTACCGT               | ~~AGCTGC~~ATTACCGT                         |
| 8     | AGCTGCA**T**TACCGT               | ~~AGCTGCA~~TTACCGT                         |
| 9     | AGCTGCAT**T**ACCGT               | ~~AGCTGCAT~~TACCGT                         |
| 10    | AGCTGCATT**A**CCGT               | ~~AGCTGCATT~~ACCGT                         |
| 11    | AGCTGCATTA**C**CGT               | ~~AGCTGCATTA~~CCGT                         |
| 12    | AGCTGCATTAC**C**GT               | ~~AGCTGCATTAC~~CGT                         |
| 13    | AGCTGCATTACC**G**T               | ~~AGCTGCATTACC~~GT                         |
| 14    | AGCTGCATTACCG**T**               | ~~AGCTGCATTACCG~~T                         |

Notice that each **i-th** suffix is just a **substring** of the genome, starting at the **i-th** character and extending till the end. The actual substrings are there for demonstration purposes, all information a suffix array contains can be represented with one copy of the genome and the numerical array (So the computer does not have to store all the repeated strings). 



To make the Suffix Array actually useful for string search, we need to **sort** it. Sorting of strings that are up to certain lengths and with a fixed alphabet system is typically done through **lexicographical** ordering system. The idea behind **lexicographical ordering** is that, given a x character alphabet system and a fixed length n, there will be at most x^n unique strings we can construct. And with some **combinatorics** magic we can define a **one-to-one and onto function** that maps every string to a integer between 1 and x^n (or 0 and x^n-1). We can then compare the strings like we compare integers. 

For convenience of illustration, we will drop the lexicographical order and simply define that: 

​																					A<T<C<G

When comparing 2 strings, we simply proceed to the first character position that the strings differ at and apply the above rule (e.g. AA < AT < AC < AG). If one of the string is an exact prefix of the other, then the shorter string is considered smaller (e.g. A < AC < ACT < ACTG).  If we apply the rule to the suffix array, we get: 

| Index | Original-Index | Represented Substring |
| ----- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| 1     | 7              | ATTACCGT              |
| 2     | 11             | ACCGT                 |
| 3     | 1              | AGCTGCATTACCGT        |
| 4     | 14             | T                     |
| 5     | 9              | TACCGT                |
| 6     | 8              | TTACCGT               |
| 7     | 4              | TGCATTACCGT           |
| 8     | 6              | CATTACCGT             |
| 9     | 3              | CTGCATTACCGT          |
| 10    | 11             | CCGT                  |
| 11    | 12             | CGT                   |
| 12    | 13             | GT                    |
| 13    | 5              | GCATTACCGT            |
| 14    | 2              | GCTGCATTACCGT         |

The **Suffix Array** is ready to handle string search tasks 

Below is an example of searching string CGT in the genome with **binary search** in SA

![alt](https://github.com/wel268/BENG183_FA2020_courseproject/blob/main/Group18____Parker%20C%C3%B4t%C3%A9_Julia%20Jones_Weishan%20Li/BinarySearch.gif?raw=true)

Using binary search, we are able to reduce the range we need to search to half after each string to string comparison. 

Thus we may accomplish any search task in **O(Log(N)M)** comparisons, where M is the string size and N is the genome size

### Pros and Cons of STAR
#### Pros:
1. **Alignment time complexity** O(log(N)M): This is much *faster* than the naïve string search method due to the underlying suffix array used in searches

1. **Ability to handle indels and mismatches**: The naïve method can only handle exact matches and these features are very common in the RNA data that STAR deals with. Because of their prevalence, *exact matches are not always required for biological data to be relevant*.

#### Cons:
1. **Memory Intensive**: Since we access the text through binary search, the entire genome needs to be kept in RAM. This is very memory intensive considering the size of the average genome STAR will handle.
